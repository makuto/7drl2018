* Building
Make sure to have ~jam~ and ~libSFML~ installed and run ~git submodule update --init --recursive~.

* Setup

** Clone repository
Clone and init submodules for dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/makuto/7drl2018
#+END_SRC

If you didn't do submodules, run this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+END_SRC
** Set up build system
Jam is used to build the project. Install Jam:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install jam
#+END_SRC

** Build dependencies
Currently, SFML relies on system installs for its dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install libopenal-dev libvorbis-dev libflac-dev libglew
#+END_SRC

Build the rest of the dependencies from source:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./BuildDependencies_Release.sh
#+END_SRC

Use the ~*_Debug.sh~ scripts if you want debug symbols. Note that you need to use Debug/Release scripts in every case, otherwise the libraries will fail to link.

** Build project

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./Build_Release.sh
#+END_SRC

Finally, run ~./7drl2018~.
